# Manual QC Testing: Google OAuth Implementation

## Overview
This issue provides comprehensive manual testing instructions for the Google OAuth authentication feature implementation. The feature adds Google OAuth login/signup alongside existing email/password authentication.

## Pre-Testing Setup

### Environment Requirements
- [ ] Google Chrome or Firefox browser (for OAuth testing)
- [ ] Access to Google account for testing
- [ ] Development environment running (`npm run dev`)
- [ ] Database migrated with OAuth fields
- [ ] OAuth secrets configured in environment

### Test Data Preparation
- [ ] Create test Google account (or use existing)
- [ ] Have existing email/password user account ready
- [ ] Note down test email addresses for conflict testing

## Core OAuth Flow Testing

### 1. New User OAuth Signup
**Objective**: Verify new users can create accounts via Google OAuth

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to `/signup`
2. Click "Sign up with Google" button
3. Complete Google OAuth consent flow
4. Verify redirect back to application
5. Check user is logged in
6. Navigate to `/profile`
7. Verify Google account information is displayed

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] OAuth button redirects to Google
- [ ] Google consent screen appears
- [ ] Successful redirect back to app
- [ ] User automatically logged in
- [ ] Profile shows Google account details
- [ ] User created in database with `provider='google'`

**Error Cases to Test**:
- [ ] Click "Deny" on Google consent → Should redirect to login with error
- [ ] Cancel OAuth flow → Should return to signup page

### 2. Existing OAuth User Login
**Objective**: Verify returning OAuth users can sign in

**Steps**:
1. Log out if logged in
2. Navigate to `/login`
3. Click "Continue with Google" button
4. Complete OAuth flow with same Google account
5. Verify successful login and redirect

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] Successful OAuth login
- [ ] User data updated (display name, profile picture)
- [ ] Redirect to intended page or dashboard

### 3. Account Linking Flow
**Objective**: Verify existing email users can link Google accounts

**Steps**:
1. Log in with existing email/password account
2. Navigate to `/profile`
3. Locate "Connected Accounts" section
4. Click "Link Google Account" button
5. Complete OAuth flow
6. Verify successful linking
7. Log out and log back in with Google OAuth

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] Link button visible for non-OAuth users
- [ ] OAuth flow completes successfully
- [ ] Profile shows Google account as connected
- [ ] Can log in with either email/password OR Google OAuth
- [ ] User data enhanced with Google information

### 4. Hybrid Authentication Testing
**Objective**: Verify both auth methods work simultaneously

**Steps**:
1. Test login with email/password (existing functionality)
2. Test login with Google OAuth (new functionality)
3. Test account linking between the two
4. Verify existing email users aren't affected

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] Email/password login still works perfectly
- [ ] OAuth login works independently
- [ ] Users can have both authentication methods
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality

## Error Scenario Testing

### 5. Email Conflict Handling
**Objective**: Test behavior when OAuth email matches existing email account

**Steps**:
1. Create email/password account with email `test@example.com`
2. Log out
3. Try to sign up with Google OAuth using same email `test@example.com`
4. Verify error handling

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] OAuth flow redirects to login page
- [ ] Error message: "An account with this email already exists. Please log in with your password or link your Google account."
- [ ] Email field pre-populated with the conflicting email
- [ ] User can log in with password and then link Google account

### 6. Account Already Linked Testing
**Objective**: Test behavior when trying to link already-linked Google account

**Steps**:
1. Have Google account linked to User A
2. Log in as User B (different user)
3. Try to link the same Google account
4. Verify error handling

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] Error message displayed: "This Google account is already linked to another user."
- [ ] No changes made to either user account
- [ ] User B remains logged in

### 7. Invalid OAuth Flow Testing
**Objective**: Test security and error handling

**Steps**:
1. Manually modify OAuth state parameter in URL
2. Try OAuth flow with malformed authorization code
3. Test with missing parameters
4. Test rate limiting (make 15+ rapid requests)

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] Tampered state tokens rejected
- [ ] Invalid codes handled gracefully
- [ ] Missing parameters show appropriate errors
- [ ] Rate limiting activates after threshold
- [ ] All errors redirect to login with meaningful messages

## User Interface Testing

### 8. OAuth Button Integration
**Objective**: Verify UI components work correctly

**Steps**:
1. Check OAuth button appearance on `/login`
2. Check OAuth button appearance on `/signup`
3. Check account linking UI on `/profile`
4. Test responsive design on mobile
5. Verify button hover states and accessibility

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] OAuth buttons clearly visible and styled consistently
- [ ] Google logo and text clearly readable
- [ ] Divider ("or") properly displayed between OAuth and email options
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile devices
- [ ] Hover effects work properly
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works for accessibility

### 9. Profile Page Enhancement
**Objective**: Test enhanced profile page with OAuth information

**Steps**:
1. Log in with OAuth user
2. Navigate to `/profile`
3. Verify Google account information display
4. Test with email/password user (should show link option)
5. Test with linked account (should show connected status)

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] "Account Information" section shows provider type
- [ ] "Connected Accounts" section displays appropriately
- [ ] Google account info (email, display name) shown when connected
- [ ] Link button appears for non-OAuth users
- [ ] Connected status shown for linked accounts
- [ ] Profile picture from Google displayed if available

## Security Testing

### 10. Rate Limiting Verification
**Objective**: Verify rate limiting protects against abuse

**Steps**:
1. Make 10+ rapid requests to `/api/auth/google`
