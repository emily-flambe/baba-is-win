# Issue 50 Requirements Analysis

## Overview
**Issue #50**: "enable users to sign up for email updates"
- **Status**: OPEN  
- **Author**: emily-flambe
- **Labels**: enhancement
- **Created**: July 8, 2025

## Core Requirements

### 1. Email Notification System
Users must be able to enable and customize email notifications for new content:
- **New thoughts** (short-form content)
- **New blog posts** (long-form content)
- **Announcements** (site-wide notifications)

### 2. User Configuration
- Users can opt-in to email notifications during signup
- Users can modify their email preferences after registration
- Granular control over notification types (thoughts vs blog posts vs announcements)

### 3. One-Click Unsubscribe
- All emails must include a link for single-click unsubscribe
- Unsubscribe links must be secure and tamper-proof
- Unsubscribe process should provide confirmation to users

### 4. Automated Triggering
- Email notifications should be automatically triggered when new content is published
- System should respect user preferences (only send emails they opted into)
- Notifications should include relevant content information and links

## Technical Infrastructure Status

### ✅ Already Implemented
1. **Database Schema**: Email preferences are complete
   - `email_blog_updates` column for blog post notifications
   - `email_thought_updates` column for thought notifications  
   - `email_announcements` column for announcement notifications

2. **User Interface**: Signup form includes email preference checkboxes

3. **Authentication**: Full user authentication system with JWT tokens

4. **Data Models**: User types include email preference fields

### ❌ Missing Components
1. **Email Sending Service**: No email delivery mechanism
2. **Unsubscribe System**: No unsubscribe links or handling
3. **Email Templates**: No email template system
4. **Notification Triggers**: No system to detect new content and trigger emails
5. **Profile Management**: Profile page doesn't allow updating email preferences

## Content Structure

### Blog Posts
- **Location**: `/src/data/blog-posts/published/`
- **Frontmatter**: title, publishDate, description, tags, thumbnail
- **Format**: Markdown with comprehensive metadata

### Thoughts
- **Location**: `/src/data/thoughts/published/`
- **Frontmatter**: content, publishDate, publishTime, tags
- **Format**: Markdown with minimal metadata

## Platform Constraints

### Deployment Environment
- **Platform**: Cloudflare Workers environment
- **Database**: Cloudflare D1 (SQLite-based)
- **Framework**: Astro with server-side rendering
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with secure cookies

### Technical Considerations
- **Execution Time Limits**: Cloudflare Workers have limited execution time
- **Database Queries**: Need efficient queries for subscriber lists
- **Email Service Integration**: Must work with external email providers
- **Security**: Unsubscribe links must be secure

## User Experience Requirements

### User Stories
1. **As a user**, I want to opt-in to email notifications during signup
2. **As a user**, I want to receive emails when new blog posts are published
3. **As a user**, I want to receive emails when new thoughts are published
4. **As a user**, I want to unsubscribe from emails with a single click
5. **As a user**, I want to manage my email preferences in my profile

### Email Content Requirements
- **Blog Post Notifications**: Include title, description, publish date, and link
- **Thought Notifications**: Include content, publish date, tags, and link
- **Unsubscribe Link**: Every email must include one-click unsubscribe
- **Branding**: Emails should match site's personality and tone
