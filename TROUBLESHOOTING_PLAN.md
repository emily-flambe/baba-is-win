# Email Notification System Troubleshooting Plan

## Issue: GitHub Issue #65 - Email notifications not working for new blog posts/thoughts

### System Architecture Overview
Based on comprehensive codebase analysis, the email notification system consists of:

1. **GitHub Actions Trigger** (`.github/workflows/deploy-and-notify.yml`)
   - Triggers on pushes to main with content changes
   - Calls `/api/admin/trigger-content-sync` after deployment

2. **Cloudflare Workers Processing**
   - Manual trigger: `/src/pages/api/admin/trigger-content-sync.ts`
   - Cron jobs: `/src/pages/api/cron/process-notifications.ts` (every 6 hours)
   - Core services: ContentProcessor and EmailNotificationService

3. **Gmail API Integration**
   - OAuth2 authentication with refresh tokens
   - Batch processing (10 emails per batch, 2s delays)
   - Comprehensive error handling and retry logic

4. **Database Layer (Cloudflare D1)**
   - 8 tables: users, email_notifications, content_items, etc.
   - Complete audit trail and analytics

### Troubleshooting Phases

#### Phase 1: Environment & Configuration Check ⏳
- [ ] Verify environment variables (Gmail OAuth2, CRON_SECRET, etc.)
- [ ] Check database schema and migrations status
- [ ] Validate wrangler.json configuration
- [ ] Ensure `.dev.vars` not blocking production

#### Phase 2: Database State Investigation ⏳
- [ ] Query recent content items and notification status
- [ ] Check subscriber count and email preferences
- [ ] Review failed notifications and error patterns
- [ ] Validate email statistics and processing metrics

#### Phase 3: Trigger Mechanism Analysis ⏳
- [ ] Examine recent GitHub Actions workflow runs
- [ ] Test manual trigger endpoint with authentication
- [ ] Review Cloudflare Workers cron job logs
- [ ] Verify deployment success and timing

#### Phase 4: Content Processing Verification ⏳
- [ ] Test content synchronization from filesystem
- [ ] Verify hash-based change detection
- [ ] Check markdown parsing and frontmatter extraction
- [ ] Validate new content notification triggering

#### Phase 5: Email Service Testing ⏳
- [ ] Test Gmail API authentication and token refresh
- [ ] Check API quota limits and usage
- [ ] Verify email template rendering
- [ ] Test single email send functionality

#### Phase 6: Notification Pipeline Testing ⏳
- [ ] Test subscriber retrieval by content type
- [ ] Verify batch processing and rate limiting
- [ ] Check error handling and retry logic
- [ ] Test unsubscribe URL generation

#### Phase 7: System Health & Monitoring ⏳
- [ ] Review Cloudflare Workers function logs
- [ ] Check email statistics dashboard
- [ ] Test admin notification interface
- [ ] Verify monitoring and alerting systems

### Recent Context
Recent content published but notifications not sent:
- `9d1d39d` - Republish "I love Cloudflare" blog post
- `92dc4ee` - Add new thought about cute subagents  
- `493bc86` - Add new thought about SWE job posting insights

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Email notifications sent for recent content
- [ ] Monitoring shows healthy notification pipeline
- [ ] Root cause identified and documented
- [ ] Prevention measures implemented
