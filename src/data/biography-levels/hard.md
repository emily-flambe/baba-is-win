Welcome to my bio on Hard difficulty! Fallen units in Hard mode are lost forever. In fact, many things are lost forever. Innocence, youth, the sweet pain of a heart learning to fall in love.

Yet many things persist forever, too - an inescapable feeling of inadequacy, a failure to live up to your own standards, the creeping sensation of profound and cosmic loneliness every time you remember - or perhaps realize again for the first time - that nobody will ever really understand <em>you</em>?

Then again, can you blame them? After all, do you understand yourself?

Every day you tread a narrow path cut into the wall of a deep crater. It only goes around and around. You cannot climb out. It is all you can do to look forward, walk straight, and pray to an indifferent God that you won't fall in. But one day, you will.

Hmm, what else...

I have an extreme amount of patience for the misbehaviors of animals and, very unfortunately, men I am attracted to (but I repeat myself). I have little patience for children (I know it's not their fault, except sometimes it is!) and troglodytes on the internet. You would think nobody on HackerNews ever pushed a bug to production - sheesh!

I am easy to befriend - at least, I think? Yet my background and interests make me profoundly unrelatable. I'm vegan and absolutely do NOT want to hear about how you "can't give up cheese." Why is it always cheese? At least the internet grew bored of obsessing over bacon. GOD, that was tedious.

I enjoy spending lots of time alone. Don't get your hopes up, <em>bachelors</em>.

I will <em>literally</em> escape into the mountains for at least 4 months the MOMENT the following conditions are met: 1) my cats are dead; 2) it's not an election year; 3) current month is between April and July.

Thanks for reading!
