This blog post has been living rent-free in my head for a few weeks now: [If you are useful, it doesn't mean you are valued](https://betterthanrandom.substack.com/p/if-you-are-useful-it-doesnt-mean)

An excerpt:

> Being <span style="color: yellow">useful</span> means that you are good at getting things done in a specific area, so that people above you can delegate that completely. You are reliable, efficient, maybe even indispensable in the short term. But you are seen primarily as a gap-filler, someone who delivers on tasks that have to be done but are not necessarily a core component of the company strategy. ...
>
> Being <span style="color: #00ff00">valued</span>, on the other hand, means that you are brought into more conversations, not just to execute, but to help shape the direction. This comes with opportunities to grow and contribute in ways that are meaningful to you and the business.

The main thesis of the article is that being _<span style="color: #00ff00">valued</span>_ is the way to advance in one's career. I'm not sure I completely agree with that conclusion, but I'm not really interested in debating that point.

What is more interesting to me is how the distinction between being _<span style="color: yellow">useful</span>_ versus being _<span style="color: #00ff00">valued</span>_ has helped solidify in my mind something that has repeatedly haunted me over the years.

## I get hired to be <span style="color: yellow">useful</span> when I really want to be <span style="color: #00ff00">valued</span>

Every time I have been hired, I have been hired to be _<span style="color: yellow">useful</span>_ to somebody else, and I have accepted every new opportunity, going as far back as graduate school, hoping to be _<span style="color: #00ff00">valued</span>_. Over the months that unfold, I grow disillusioned - usually slowly and non-monotonically - until ultimately I conclude, rightly or not, that I am not <span style="color: #00ff00">valued</span> as much as I "deserve" to be.

An (arguably) inflated sense of self-worth, and a propensity to <span style="color: #00ff00">value</span> others (in particular, bosses and leadership) who do not share my very high assessment of my own <span style="color: #00ff00">valuableness</span>, make for a potently toxic combination that has left me feeling bitter and disappointed more than once.

Is this simply the nature of boss-subordinate relationships? Probably! Will it happen again? Maybe! This is probably why people found startups. Maybe it just sucks to be managed?

## Friends and critters

Outside of the career context, "<span style="color: yellow">useful</span>ness" isn't really a metric I use to evaluate my relationships. I do have very smart and knowledgeable friends, and I enjoy learning from them, but they are only very rarely <span style="color: yellow">useful</span></span> to me. (Most of them live very far away and are thus incapable of being <span style="color: yellow">useful</span></span> for, e.g., moving heavy things.) I don't need my friends to be <span style="color: yellow">useful</span></span> for me to <span style="color: #00ff00">value</span> them. I know for a fact that they don't find me <span style="color: yellow">useful</span></span>, because mostly I just sit around vibecoding <a href="/museum" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extremely non-useful pet projects</a> and playing video games in my goon cave.

My point is that what makes my friends _friends_ instead of friendly acquaintances is, in large part, the mutual sense that we <span style="color: #00ff00">value</span> each other despite being quite useless.

I feel the same way about my cats, which are less-than-useless 99.99% of the time - although Mia _did_ eat a moth today, and I am very proud of her!

And yes, I've deviated somewhat from the original definitions of "<span style="color: yellow">useful</span>" and "<span style="color: #00ff00">valued</span>" in the blog post I linked at the top of this post. I really don't care, do u?

# How to advance in your career????

I dunno, man. Being <span style="color: yellow">useful</span></span> is going to help you a lot more than being useless. You probably aren't <span style="color: #00ff00">valued</span> as much as you think you should be <span style="color: #00ff00">valued</span>. And you shouldn't let that reality detract from the amount that you <span style="color: #00ff00">value</span> yourself. If you figure out how to convince others to <span style="color: #00ff00">value</span> you as much as you <span style="color: #00ff00">value</span> you, it would be very _<span style="color: yellow">useful</span></span>_(!) if you could let me know.

Have I have grown old and cynical? You bet! Just wait until I start blogging about romance for real.

## In conclusion

I find it easy and natural to genuinely <span style="color: #00ff00">value</span> others. And it has on several occasions made me very sad to realize that feeling is not as mutual as I initially imagined it to be.

Such is life! Best not to dwell in bitterness about it - it's bad for the skin. A better use of time would be to think about whether I am successfully communicating to people I <span style="color: #00ff00">value</span> that I <span style="color: #00ff00">value</span> them, so they can blog about something else.

## Is <span style="color: #00ff00">"value"</span> just another word for <span style="color:rgb(227, 102, 218)">"love"</span>?

Words are a social construct!

## This was an uncharacteristically sincere post

Don't get used to it!
