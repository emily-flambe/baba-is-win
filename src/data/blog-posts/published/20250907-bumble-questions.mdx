import BumblePromptsGrid from '../../../components/BumblePromptsGrid.astro';

So I decided to answer every single Bumble prompt because... why not? If you're going to put yourself out there on dating apps, might as well go all in, right?

But here's the twist: Below you'll find FOUR different sets of answers to all the prompts - my real ones mixed in with three AI-generated personas. Can you guess which one is actually me? 

The AI was given different personalities:
- One that's overly earnest and sincere
- One that's trying way too hard to be funny
- One with generic dating app responses

Click on any prompt to reveal the answer. The positions are randomized on each page load, so good luck figuring out which one is the real me!

## Some Final Thoughts

There you have it - every single Bumble prompt answered with varying degrees of honesty and humor. Will this help me find love? Probably not. But at least now when someone asks "which prompt should I answer?" I can definitively say "all of them, apparently."

If you're on the apps, feel free to steal any of these (but maybe personalize them a bit, yeah?). And remember: the best profile is an authentic one. Unless you're also terrified of butterflies, in which case, maybe keep that one to yourself for a bit.

Happy swiping!
