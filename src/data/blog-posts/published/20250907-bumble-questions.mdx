import BumblePrompts from '../../../components/BumblePrompts.astro';

So I decided to answer every single Bumble prompt because... why not? If you're going to put yourself out there on dating apps, might as well go all in, right?

But here's the twist: Below you'll find different versions of all the prompts. Use the tone selector to switch between:
- **opus 4**: What Claude thinks I'm like based on my website
- **gpt-oss**: [Placeholder for GPT-generated responses]
- **me lmao**: My actual responses (coming soon!)

Click on any prompt to reveal the answer. Have fun exploring the different vibes!

## Some Final Thoughts

There you have it - every single Bumble prompt answered with varying degrees of honesty and humor. Will this help me find love? Probably not. But at least now when someone asks "which prompt should I answer?" I can definitively say "all of them, apparently."

If you're on the apps, feel free to steal any of these (but maybe personalize them a bit, yeah?). And remember: the best profile is an authentic one. Unless you're also terrified of butterflies, in which case, maybe keep that one to yourself for a bit.

Happy swiping!
