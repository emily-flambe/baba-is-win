This is a premium blog post that demonstrates the content paywall system. Anonymous users will only see the first fifty words of this content before it gets truncated with ellipsis.

The premium content system works by checking the `premium: true` flag in the frontmatter of content files. When this flag is present, the content processing utilities will:

1. Show full content to authenticated users
2. Truncate content for anonymous users based on content type:
   - Blog posts: 50 words maximum
   - Thoughts: 10 words maximum

This allows the site to provide value to both anonymous visitors (who can preview content) and authenticated users (who get full access). The system encourages user registration while still maintaining an open, accessible platform.

The implementation includes comprehensive TypeScript types, utility functions for content processing, and proper integration with the existing authentication middleware. All content processing is handled server-side to ensure security and prevent client-side bypassing of the paywall restrictions.

This blog post contains enough content to demonstrate the truncation behavior when viewed by anonymous users, while authenticated users will see this complete explanation of the premium content system.
