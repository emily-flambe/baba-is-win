    Summer begins with a relentless and vengeful sun. Few other cyclists are out today; I guess they know better.
    
    As I crane my neck to let the wind bring the slightest relief, I feel a psychic resonance with my primordial ancestors. I picture them sweating and surviving in the Serengeti, as I now sweat and survive on US Highway 36. I sense a primal kinship with those who came before me, generation upon generation, centuries stretching into millennia of an unfathomable past.
    
    I turn on my smartwatch to check my heart rate and skip to the next song. Pulsating through my bone conductance headphones, Sabrina Carpenter sings about coffee or some shit.
