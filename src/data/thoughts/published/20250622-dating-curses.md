    Posted a new blog about [cursed first dates](/blog/20250622-cursed-first-dates) today. Writing it made me realize how many disaster dates I've survived.
    
    The weird thing is, I remember the catastrophic ones more vividly than the perfectly pleasant ones. Maybe our brains are just wired to catalog chaos better than contentment. Or maybe the disasters make better stories.
    
    Either way, I'm grateful for every awkward museum security incident and soggy picnic sandwich. They're all data points in the grand experiment of figuring out how humans connect with each other.
