title: "You're absolutely right!"
content: |
  Claude Code won't <em>FUCKING</em> stop telling me "you're absolutely right!", despite <a href="https://github.com/emily-flambe/SuperClaude/blob/main/SuperClaude/Core/PRINCIPLES.md#2-no-flattery-or-agreement-phrases" target="_blank">specific guidelines in my Claude system config</a>, an explicit instruction included in the initial prompt when I start `claude` (via my `claudia` alias), and <a href="https://github.com/emily-flambe/web-app-starter-pack/blob/main/.project/guidelines/core/ai-behavior.md#2-no-flattery-or-agreement-phrases" target="_blank">steering guides</a> in all of my projects clearly forbidding flattering language.

  So I finally made a <a href="https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/956bcab7-6c40-4963-a9ef-2f378638bc8e" target="_blank">Claude hook that tells it to STFU and try again if that happens.</a>

  Anthropic is saved! You're welcome, DARIO SENPAI.
