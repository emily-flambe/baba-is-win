content: |
    I asked Claude to design a dating app, <a href="https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/e7f6ad7b-fce2-49f9-b9da-7599079a10fb" target="_blank">TuranDATE</a>, based on Puccini's opera <em>Turandot</em>, in which suitors must solve three riddles or be executed. The dream!

    PS: even before vibecoding, everyone and their goldfish thought they had a new idea to revolutionize online dating. It's probably about to get even stupider out there. MAYBE we can all make our OWN dating apps (√† la Bojack Horseman)? Then, once you match with someone on [Match-owned dating app of choice], you invite each other to your personal dating apps? And THEN ghost each other üëç

    PPS: <em>Turandot</em> is only 90% complete because Puccini died before he could finish it, meaning the final 10% is left as an exercise for the producer. Does the prince get the girl? Or does she turn into a dragon and devour him? we report you decide
