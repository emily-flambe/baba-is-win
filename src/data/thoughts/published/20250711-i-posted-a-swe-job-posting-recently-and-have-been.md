    I posted a SWE job posting recently and have been utterly inundated with AI-generated applications. Y'all WILDIN. So I'm vibecoding a tool using the Recruitee API and AI to root out the AI candidates. Game recognize game... I hope.

    Recruitee's API also makes it very easy to bulk auto-apply to jobs. Why????
