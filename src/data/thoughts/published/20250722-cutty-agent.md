title: "Cutty the Cuttlefish and also Therapist"
content: |
    I am working on an <a href="https://github.com/emily-flambe/cutty-agent" target="_blank">AI Agent</a> for my <a href="https://cutty.emilycogsdill.com" target="_blank">shitty and weird Cutty app</a>. Session isolation actually seems to be non-trivial (probably a skill issue), so the entire public internet can access the same chat logs with my comically unhelpful cuttlefish chatbot <a href="https://cutty-agent.emily-cogsdill.workers.dev/" target="_blank">here</a>. lol ðŸ¦‘
    
    It <em>does</em> use my Anthropic API key, but I'm not too worried. How much could a token possibly cost? Twelve dollars?
