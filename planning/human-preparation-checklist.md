# Human Preparation Checklist

## ‚úÖ Status: COMPLETED

All human preparation steps have been completed successfully. The email notifications system is ready for technical implementation.

## Overview
This document outlined the preparation steps needed before beginning technical implementation of the email notifications system. All external dependencies and configurations are now in place.

## üöÄ Pre-Implementation Preparation Tasks

### 1. Google Cloud Console Setup ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Priority**: Critical - Must complete before development begins

#### Create Google Cloud Project ‚úÖ
- [x] Visit [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
- [x] Create a new project or select existing project
- [x] Note the project ID for reference

#### Enable Gmail API ‚úÖ

- [x] Copy and save the refresh token securely

### 2. Environment Configuration ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Priority**: Critical - Required for all development work

#### Development Environment Variables
Create or update `.env.local` with:
```bash
# Gmail OAuth2 Configuration
GMAIL_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
GMAIL_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_refresh_token_here
GMAIL_SENDER_EMAIL=your_sender_email@gmail.com

# Site Configuration
SITE_URL=http://localhost:4321
SITE_NAME=Your Site Name

# Existing variables (keep as-is)
DB=your_existing_db_config
JWT_SECRET=your_existing_jwt_secret
```

### 3. Configure Cloudflare Workers Secrets ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Priority**: Critical - Required for production deployment

OAuth2 credentials have been set as Wrangler secrets:

```bash
# ‚úÖ All Gmail API secrets are configured:
# GMAIL_CLIENT_ID - set
# GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET - set  
# GMAIL_REFRESH_TOKEN - set
# GMAIL_SENDER_EMAIL - set
# JWT_SECRET - set

# Verification command used:
# wrangler secret list
```

**Security**: All sensitive values are properly stored as Wrangler secrets and not committed to code.

### 4. Required Information to Collect ‚úÖ COMPLETED
1. **Gmail OAuth2 Client ID** - ‚úÖ Collected and configured
2. **Gmail OAuth2 Client Secret** - ‚úÖ Collected and configured
3. **Gmail Refresh Token** - ‚úÖ Generated and configured
4. **Sender Email Address** - ‚úÖ Configured in secrets
5. **Site URL** - ‚úÖ Set to https://personal.emily-cogsdill.workers.dev
6. **Site Name** - ‚úÖ Set to "Emily's Blog"

### 5. Test Accounts Setup
- 3-5 test email accounts for delivery testing
- 3-5 test user accounts with different preferences
- 1 admin account for notification management

### 6. Security Considerations
- Store all credentials securely (never commit to code)
- Use environment variables for all sensitive data
- Enable 2FA on Gmail account
- Monitor for suspicious activity

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Gmail API Limits**: Be aware of daily quota limits (1 billion units/day)
2. **Email Reputation**: Monitor sender reputation to avoid spam filtering
3. **Privacy Compliance**: Ensure compliance with email privacy regulations
4. **Testing Strategy**: Plan for comprehensive testing before production deployment
5. **Rollback Plan**: Have a plan to disable email notifications if issues occur

## üîÑ Validation Checklist ‚úÖ ALL COMPLETED

Before starting development, verify:
- [x] Gmail API is enabled and working
- [x] OAuth2 credentials are valid and stored securely as Wrangler secrets
- [x] Application is deployed to https://personal.emily-cogsdill.workers.dev
- [x] Database is connected and migrations are applied
- [x] All required secrets are configured
- [x] Security review is complete

## üöÄ Ready for Technical Implementation

All human preparation steps are complete. The email notifications system infrastructure is ready for:
1. Email template implementation
2. Notification processing logic
3. Content change detection
4. Unsubscribe functionality
5. Testing and validation
