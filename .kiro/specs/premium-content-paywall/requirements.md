# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a premium content system that provides teaser previews of special content to anonymous users while granting full access to authenticated users. The system creates a paywall-like experience to encourage user registration and engagement, similar to subscription-based content platforms.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to mark certain thoughts and blog posts as premium content, so that I can provide exclusive value to registered users while still teasing the content to drive signups.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a content creator marks a thought or blog post as premium THEN the system SHALL store this designation in the content metadata
2. WHEN premium content is displayed to anonymous users THEN the system SHALL show only a preview portion with a fade-out effect
3. WHEN premium content is displayed to authenticated users THEN the system SHALL show the complete content without restrictions
4. IF content is not marked as premium THEN the system SHALL display it fully to all users regardless of authentication status

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an anonymous visitor, I want to see preview teasers of premium content, so that I can understand the value proposition and be motivated to create an account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an anonymous user views premium content THEN the system SHALL display approximately 150-200 words or 2-3 paragraphs as a preview
2. WHEN the preview ends THEN the system SHALL apply a visual fade-out effect to indicate more content is available
3. WHEN premium content preview is shown THEN the system SHALL display a clear call-to-action prompting user registration or login
4. WHEN an anonymous user attempts to access premium content directly THEN the system SHALL redirect to the preview version with authentication prompts

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to access premium content in full after logging in, so that I can enjoy the exclusive benefits of my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user views premium content THEN the system SHALL display the complete content without truncation
2. WHEN an authenticated user accesses premium content THEN the system SHALL not show any paywall overlays or authentication prompts
3. WHEN premium content is accessed by authenticated users THEN the system SHALL maintain the same styling and layout as regular content
4. IF a user's authentication expires while viewing premium content THEN the system SHALL gracefully transition to the preview mode

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to easily designate content as premium during creation or editing, so that I can efficiently manage my content strategy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating new thoughts or blog posts THEN the system SHALL provide a simple toggle or checkbox to mark content as premium
2. WHEN editing existing content THEN the system SHALL allow changing the premium status without affecting other content properties
3. WHEN premium content is saved THEN the system SHALL validate and store the premium designation in the content metadata
4. WHEN content premium status changes THEN the system SHALL immediately reflect the change in public-facing displays
