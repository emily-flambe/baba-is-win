## Introduction

This feature adds an interactive difficulty selector to the biography section of the personal website, allowing users to choose between different levels of biographical detail. The system will provide five difficulty levels ranging from basic facts (Tutorial) to comprehensive detail (Maddening), giving users control over how much information they want to consume.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to select different difficulty levels for the biography content, so that I can choose the amount of detail that matches my interest level.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN a user selects a difficulty level THEN the system SHALL immediately update the displayed biography content to match the selected difficulty
3. WHEN a user refreshes the page THEN the system SHALL remember their last selected difficulty level using local storage
4. WHEN no difficulty has been previously selected THEN the system SHALL default to "Normal" difficulty

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the difficulty selector to be visually intuitive and engaging, so that I understand what each level represents and am encouraged to explore different options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the difficulty selector is displayed THEN each difficulty level SHALL have a distinct visual style that suggests its complexity level
2. WHEN a user hovers over a difficulty option THEN the system SHALL provide a brief tooltip or description of what that level contains
3. WHEN a difficulty level is selected THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual feedback showing which level is currently active
4. WHEN the biography content changes THEN the system SHALL use smooth transitions to avoid jarring content switches

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As the website owner, I want to easily manage different biography content for each difficulty level, so that I can update and maintain the content without complex technical changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the system THEN each difficulty level SHALL have its own clearly defined content structure
2. WHEN content needs to be updated THEN the system SHALL allow easy modification of individual difficulty levels without affecting others
3. WHEN a new difficulty level is added THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the addition without breaking existing functionality
4. WHEN content is missing for a difficulty level THEN the system SHALL fall back to a default message or the next available level

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the biography difficulty selector to work seamlessly across different devices and browsers, so that I have a consistent experience regardless of how I access the site.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the biography on mobile devices THEN the difficulty selector SHALL be fully functional and appropriately sized for touch interaction
2. WHEN using different browsers THEN the difficulty selector SHALL maintain consistent functionality and appearance
3. WHEN JavaScript is disabled THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to show the default biography content
4. WHEN the page loads THEN the difficulty selector SHALL be immediately interactive without requiring additional loading time
