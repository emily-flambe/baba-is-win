# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The email notification system allows users to subscribe to email updates about new blog posts, thoughts, or announcements. Users can manage their subscription preferences and unsubscribe at any time. The current implementation has a flawed email sending mechanism that needs to be fixed and improved to ensure reliable delivery of notifications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to subscribe to email notifications for new content, so that I can stay updated with the latest blog posts and thoughts without having to check the website regularly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the website THEN the system SHALL provide a clear way to subscribe to email notifications
2. WHEN a user subscribes THEN the system SHALL collect their email address and subscription preferences
3. WHEN a user subscribes THEN the system SHALL send a welcome email confirming their subscription
4. WHEN a user subscribes THEN the system SHALL store their preferences in the database with proper validation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a subscribed user, I want to receive email notifications when new content is published, so that I can read the latest posts and thoughts as soon as they're available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new blog content is published THEN the system SHALL send email notifications to all users subscribed to blog updates
2. WHEN new thought content is published THEN the system SHALL send email notifications to all users subscribed to thought updates
3. WHEN sending notifications THEN the system SHALL use properly formatted HTML and text email templates
4. WHEN sending notifications THEN the system SHALL include an unsubscribe link in every email
5. WHEN sending notifications THEN the system SHALL handle rate limiting to avoid exceeding email service quotas
6. WHEN email delivery fails THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
7. WHEN email delivery permanently fails THEN the system SHALL mark the notification as failed and stop retrying

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a subscribed user, I want to manage my email preferences, so that I can choose which types of content I receive notifications for.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is logged in THEN the system SHALL provide access to email preference settings
2. WHEN a user updates preferences THEN the system SHALL save the changes immediately
3. WHEN a user updates preferences THEN the system SHALL respect the new preferences for future notifications
4. WHEN a user accesses preferences THEN the system SHALL show current subscription status for each content type

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a subscribed user, I want to easily unsubscribe from email notifications, so that I can stop receiving emails when I no longer want them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks an unsubscribe link THEN the system SHALL provide a one-click unsubscribe option
2. WHEN a user unsubscribes THEN the system SHALL immediately stop sending them notifications
3. WHEN a user unsubscribes THEN the system SHALL send a confirmation email
4. WHEN a user unsubscribes THEN the system SHALL provide options for partial unsubscribe (specific content types)
5. WHEN generating unsubscribe links THEN the system SHALL use secure, time-limited tokens

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor email delivery performance, so that I can ensure the notification system is working reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN emails are sent THEN the system SHALL log delivery status and performance metrics
2. WHEN delivery failures occur THEN the system SHALL categorize and log error details
3. WHEN monitoring the system THEN the system SHALL provide statistics on sent, failed, and pending notifications
4. WHEN system issues occur THEN the system SHALL implement circuit breaker patterns to prevent cascading failures
5. WHEN quota limits are approached THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting and backoff strategies

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the email system to be properly configured and authenticated, so that emails can be sent reliably through Gmail's API.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN the system SHALL validate all required Gmail OAuth credentials are present
2. WHEN sending emails THEN the system SHALL use valid OAuth2 access tokens with proper refresh handling
3. WHEN OAuth tokens expire THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh them using the refresh token
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry logic
5. WHEN rate limits are hit THEN the system SHALL implement proper backoff and retry strategies

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automated processing of email notifications, so that users receive timely notifications without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new content is published THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and queue notifications
2. WHEN notifications are queued THEN the system SHALL process them in batches to manage load
3. WHEN processing notifications THEN the system SHALL handle failures gracefully with retry logic
4. WHEN running scheduled tasks THEN the system SHALL clean up old notifications and expired tokens
5. WHEN processing fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and continue processing other notifications
