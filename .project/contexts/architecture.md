# System Architecture

## Overview
The baba-is-win project is built on a simple, unified architecture using a single Cloudflare Worker named 'personal' and one D1 database named 'baba-is-win-db'.

## Architecture Components

### Cloudflare Worker: 'personal'
- Single worker handling all API endpoints and serverless functions
- Handles authentication, content delivery, and all backend operations
- Auto-deploys on git push to main branch

### Database: 'baba-is-win-db'
- Single Cloudflare D1 (SQLite) database
- Contains all user data, content tracking, and application state
- Managed through sequential migrations in `/migrations/`

## Framework Integration
Following the unified documentation framework pattern for consistent architecture documentation.
