## Setup Tasks

### 1. R2 Bucket Configuration

#### Create R2 Bucket
```bash
# Create dedicated bucket for website content
wrangler r2 bucket create baba-is-win-docs

# Verify bucket creation
wrangler r2 bucket list
```

#### Bucket Structure
```
baba-is-win-docs/
â”œâ”€â”€ content/                # Main content documents
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ blog/              # Blog posts
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ thoughts/          # Thought pieces
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ museum/            # Museum items
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ biography/         # Bio variations
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ guides/            # Guides and docs
â”œâ”€â”€ metadata/              # Document metadata
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.json        # Master index file
â””â”€â”€ config/               # Configuration files
    â””â”€â”€ autorag.json     # AutoRAG configuration
```

### 2. Document Upload to R2

#### Environment Configuration
Create `.env.r2` file:
```env
R2_ENDPOINT=https://<account-id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your-access-key>
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your-secret-key>
R2_BUCKET_NAME=baba-is-win-docs
```

#### Upload Script (`scripts/upload-to-r2.js`)
```javascript
import { S3Client, PutObjectCommand } from '@aws-sdk/client-s3';
import fs from 'fs';
import path from 'path';
import { glob } from 'glob';
import dotenv from 'dotenv';

// Load environment variables
dotenv.config({ path: '.env.r2' });

// Configure R2 client
const r2Client = new S3Client({
  endpoint: process.env.R2_ENDPOINT,
  region: 'auto',
  credentials: {
    accessKeyId: process.env.R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
    secretAccessKey: process.env.R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
  }
});

async function uploadToR2() {
  console.log('ðŸš€ Uploading content to R2...\n');
  
  const MARKDOWN_DIR = './rag-markdown';
  const files = await glob(`${MARKDOWN_DIR}/**/*.md`);
  
  let uploaded = 0;
  
  for (const file of files) {
    const key = path.relative(MARKDOWN_DIR, file);
    const content = fs.readFileSync(file, 'utf-8');
    
    await r2Client.send(new PutObjectCommand({
      Bucket: process.env.R2_BUCKET_NAME,
      Key: `content/${key}`,
      Body: content,
      ContentType: 'text/markdown',
      Metadata: {
        source: 'baba-is-win',
        type: path.dirname(key),
        uploaded: new Date().toISOString()
      }
    }));
    
    uploaded++;
    console.log(`âœ“ Uploaded: ${key}`);
  }
  
  // Upload index
  const index = {
    version: '1.0',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    documentCount: uploaded,
    source: 'baba-is-win'
  };
  
  await r2Client.send(new PutObjectCommand({
    Bucket: process.env.R2_BUCKET_NAME,
    Key: 'metadata/index.json',
    Body: JSON.stringify(index, null, 2),
    ContentType: 'application/json'
  }));
  
  console.log(`\nâœ… Uploaded ${uploaded} documents to R2`);
}

uploadToR2().catch(console.error);
```

### 5. Wrangler Configuration Update

Update `wrangler.toml`:
```toml
name = "baba-is-win"
main = "src/index.ts"
compatibility_date = "2025-01-01"
node_compat = true

# Workers AI Binding for AutoRAG
[[ai]]
binding = "AI"

# R2 Bucket for content
[[r2_buckets]]
binding = "CONTENT_BUCKET"
bucket_name = "baba-is-win-docs"

# AI Gateway (optional but recommended)
[ai_gateway]
binding = "AI_GATEWAY"
endpoint = "https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/baba-is-win-rag"

# Environment variables
[vars]
AUTORAG_INSTANCE_NAME = "baba-is-win-assistant"
CHAT_RATE_LIMIT = "10"  # Queries per minute per IP

# Development environment
[env.development]
vars = { ENVIRONMENT = "development" }

# Production environment  
[env.production]
vars = { ENVIRONMENT = "production" }
```

### 6. Testing AutoRAG Instance

#### Test Script (`scripts/test-autorag.js`)
```javascript
export default {
  async fetch(request, env) {
    const testQueries = [
      "Who is Emily Cogsdill?",
      "What blog posts are available?",
      "Tell me about the museum",
      "What are Emily's thoughts on technology?",
      "How can I contact Emily?",
      "What projects has Emily worked on?",
      "What's the latest blog post?",
      "Tell me about Emily's background"
    ];
    
    const results = [];
    
    for (const query of testQueries) {
      try {
        const response = await env.AI
          .autorag(env.AUTORAG_INSTANCE_NAME)
          .aiSearch({
            query,
            rewrite_query: true,
            max_num_results: 5
          });
        
        results.push({
          query,
          answer: response.response || response.answer,
          sources: response.data?.length || 0,
          success: true
        });
      } catch (error) {
        results.push({
          query,
          error: error.message,
          success: false
        });
      }
    }
    
    return Response.json({
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      instance: env.AUTORAG_INSTANCE_NAME,
      results,
      summary: {
        total: results.length,
        successful: results.filter(r => r.success).length,
        failed: results.filter(r => !r.success).length
      }
    });
  }
};
```

### 7. Monitoring Setup

#### Metrics Dashboard Configuration
```javascript
// Create monitoring endpoints
const metrics = {
  endpoints: {
    '/api/metrics/chat': 'Chat usage statistics',
    '/api/metrics/performance': 'Response time metrics',
    '/api/metrics/quality': 'Response quality scores'
  },
  
  tracking: {
    queries_per_hour: { threshold: 100, alert: 'above' },
    avg_response_time: { threshold: 2500, alert: 'above' },
    error_rate: { threshold: 0.05, alert: 'above' },
    cache_hit_rate: { target: 0.25, alert: 'below' }
  }
};
```

### 8. Performance Optimization

#### Caching Strategy
```javascript
// Implement intelligent caching
const cacheConfig = {
  // Cache common queries
  commonQueries: [
    "Who is Emily?",
    "What is this site about?",
    "Latest blog posts",
    "Museum items"
  ],
  
  // Pre-warm cache on deployment
  prewarm: true,
  
  // Cache by user session
  sessionBased: true,
  
  // Invalidation rules
  invalidateOn: ['content_update', 'daily']
};
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **No results returned**
   - Check R2 bucket permissions
   - Verify indexing completed
   - Test with simple queries first

2. **Slow responses**
   - Enable caching
   - Reduce max_num_results
   - Use fallback model for high load

3. **Irrelevant results**
   - Increase minScore threshold
   - Enable reranking
   - Improve query rewrite prompt

4. **Missing content**
   - Verify all documents uploaded
   - Check indexing status
   - Review chunk size settings

## Success Checklist

- [ ] R2 bucket created with correct name
- [ ] All content uploaded to R2
- [ ] AutoRAG instance created in dashboard
- [ ] System prompts configured
- [ ] Indexing completed successfully
- [ ] Test queries returning good results
- [ ] Wrangler.toml updated
- [ ] Monitoring configured
- [ ] Performance acceptable (<2s responses)

## Next Phase
Once AutoRAG is configured and tested, proceed to Phase 3: Integration Development
