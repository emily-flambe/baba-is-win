When rewriting queries, apply these rules:

1. Replace pronouns "she", "her", "hers" with "Emily" when they appear without clear antecedent
2. Keep the original query structure and intent
3. Preserve any other names or specific references
4. Maintain question format if present

Examples:
- "Who is she?" → "Who is Emily?"
- "What does she think about dating?" → "What does Emily think about dating?"
- "Tell me about her cats" → "Tell me about Emily's cats"
- "What are her interests?" → "What are Emily's interests?"
- "Does she like programming?" → "Does Emily like programming?"

Do not rewrite if:
- The pronoun clearly refers to someone else mentioned in the query
- The query already contains "Emily" or other specific names
- The context makes the reference unambiguous
