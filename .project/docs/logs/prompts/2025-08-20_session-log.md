## Session Update - Cleanup Audit

### Task Received
User requested: Audit the .project/ files for factual accuracy and clean up extraneous or misleading information

### Actions Completed

1. **Verified Script References**
   - All 5 scripts mentioned in .project/README.md exist in .project/scripts/
   - Scripts are: health-check.js, setup-dev-env.js, env-validator.js, update-context.js, package-manager.js

2. **Environment Variables Audit**
   - .env.example correctly documents required variables
   - Primary email service is Resend (not Gmail)
   - Gmail OAuth marked as optional/legacy
   - Database binding confirmed as 'baba-is-win-db' in wrangler.json

3. **Package.json Validation**
   - Worker name is 'personal' (verified in wrangler.json)
   - Database name is 'baba-is-win-db' (consistent across files)
   - Scripts correctly reference these names

4. **Documentation Cleanup**
   - Removed emoji decorations from .project/README.md headings (per AI guidelines)
   - Fixed email service references in dev-guide.md (Gmail â†’ Resend)
   - Removed specific worker name references where generic would suffice
   - Ensured consistency across all documentation

### Issues Found and Fixed

1. **Emoji Usage**: Removed all emojis from .project/README.md documentation headers
2. **Email Service Confusion**: Updated dev-guide.md to correctly reference Resend as primary email service
3. **Worker Name References**: Removed unnecessary specific references to 'personal' worker name
4. **Bear References**: Removed "Bear's" branding from utility descriptions

### Files Modified
- .project/README.md - Removed emojis, updated branding
- .project/dev-guide.md - Fixed email service references, removed specific worker name references

### Result
All .project/ documentation is now factually accurate and consistent with the current codebase configuration.
