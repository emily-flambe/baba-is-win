## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### User Experience Requirements

#### Primary User Stories
- **As a logged-in user**, I want to access my account settings so I can manage my profile and preferences
- **As a user**, I want to reset my password securely when I forget it or want to change it

## Technical Implementation

### Technical Approach

#### Architecture Overview
- RESTful API endpoints for settings management
- React-based settings dashboard with form validation
- Email service integration for password reset
- Secure token-based password reset system
- Database schema extensions for user preferences

#### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express (assumed based on codebase)
- **Frontend**: React with form libraries (React Hook Form recommended)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with new settings tables
- **Email**: Existing email service or new integration (SendGrid/Nodemailer)
- **Security**: bcrypt for password hashing, JWT for tokens

### Database Changes

#### New Tables
```sql
-- User preferences table
CREATE TABLE user_preferences (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    theme VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'light',
    notifications_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    language VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'en',
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(user_id)
);

-- Password reset tokens
CREATE TABLE password_reset_tokens (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    token VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    expires_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    used BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- User activity log
CREATE TABLE user_activity_log (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    action VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    ip_address INET,
    user_agent TEXT,
    metadata JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### Table Modifications
```sql
-- Add fields to existing users table
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS last_login_at TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS profile_picture_url TEXT;
```

### API Endpoints

#### Settings Management
```
GET    /api/settings           - Get user settings and preferences
PUT    /api/settings/profile   - Update profile information
PUT    /api/settings/preferences - Update user preferences
GET    /api/settings/activity  - Get user activity log
```

#### Password Management
```
PUT    /api/settings/password  - Change password (requires current password)
POST   /api/auth/password-reset-request - Request password reset email
POST   /api/auth/password-reset - Reset password with token
GET    /api/auth/password-reset/verify/:token - Verify reset token
```

#### Security
```
GET    /api/settings/sessions  - Get active sessions
DELETE /api/settings/sessions/:id - Logout specific session
DELETE /api/settings/sessions  - Logout all sessions
DELETE /api/settings/account   - Delete account (with confirmation)
```

### Frontend Components

#### Component Structure
```
src/components/settings/
├── SettingsLayout.jsx          # Main settings page layout
├── ProfileSettings.jsx         # Profile information management
├── SecuritySettings.jsx        # Password and security options
├── PreferencesSettings.jsx     # User preferences and theme
├── ActivityLog.jsx             # Account activity display

### Security Considerations

#### Password Reset Security
- Cryptographically secure random tokens
- Token expiration (15 minutes maximum)
- Rate limiting (max 3 requests per hour per email)
- Email verification before reset
- Invalidate all sessions on password change

#### General Security
- CSRF protection on all endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- Secure session management
- Audit logging for security events

#### Privacy Considerations
- Hash all tokens before database storage
- Minimize personal data storage
- Secure email delivery
- GDPR compliance for account deletion
- Activity log retention policies
