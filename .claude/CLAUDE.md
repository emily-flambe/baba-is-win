## Key Project Rules

### File Operations
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- NEVER proactively create documentation files unless explicitly requested
- NEVER create markdown files (.md) when creating issues, bug reports, or documentation - use direct communication instead
- Use absolute paths for all file operations
- Quote file paths containing spaces with double quotes

### Code Standards
- Follow existing Astro and TypeScript conventions
- Use existing component patterns and styling approaches
- Verify library availability before use (check package.json)
- Never add comments unless explicitly requested

### Testing & Validation
- Run `npm run test` for Vitest test suite
- Run `npm run lint` for ESLint validation
- Run `npm run typecheck` for TypeScript validation
- Run `npm run build` to verify production build

### Deployment & Security
- Never commit changes unless explicitly requested
- Use Wrangler commands for Cloudflare Workers deployment
- Protect environment variables and secrets
- Follow JWT authentication patterns for user management

### Subagent Workflow
- All subagents must be given cute animal names with corresponding emojis
- Commits should start with just the subagent emoji: üêù Brief description
- **Task names must start with the archetype emoji when worked on by subagents**
- Make frequent, small commits with concise, descriptive messages
- Each subagent should maintain consistent personality and expertise area
- Hand off work between subagents based on task requirements
