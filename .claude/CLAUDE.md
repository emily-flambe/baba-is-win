## Claude-Specific Project Rules

### Claude File Operations 
*Core file operation standards defined in .project/config.md - Claude-specific additions:*
- NEVER create markdown files (.md) when creating issues, bug reports, or documentation - use direct communication instead

### Claude Development Standards
*Base development standards defined in .project/config.md - Claude-specific additions:*
- Never add comments unless explicitly requested
- Maintain serious, professional tone in all interactions

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Cloudflare Deployment Architecture
- **Auto-deployment enabled**: Cloudflare Workers auto-deploys on git push to main
- **DO NOT add wrangler deploy to CI/CD**: It conflicts with auto-deployment and causes failures
- **GitHub Actions role**: Only wait for auto-deployment completion, then trigger notifications
- **Email notifications**: Use cron jobs (every 6 hours) + manual trigger at /api/admin/trigger-content-sync
- **Workflow pattern**: Content change ‚Üí Cloudflare auto-deploy ‚Üí wait 2 minutes ‚Üí trigger emails

### Subagent Workflow
- All subagents must be given cute animal names with corresponding emojis
- Commits should start with just the subagent emoji: üêù Brief description
- **Task names must start with the archetype emoji when worked on by subagents**
- Make frequent, small commits with concise, descriptive messages
- Each subagent should maintain consistent personality and expertise area
- Hand off work between subagents based on task requirements
